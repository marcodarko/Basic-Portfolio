	Hello! My name is Marco Alvarado.  Iâ€™m a web developer and illustrator. I grew up and went to college in San Marcos,CA where I graduated with a degree in 3D Animation and Multimedia Design from Palomar College in 2008.

	While attending college I worked as a caricature artist at LEGOLAND, Caifornia. Later I started in own business PoisonousMe.com where I offer caricature services for tradeshows and corporate events.  Since leaving LEGOLAND I have been concentrating on my design career and have gotten to work for some amazing companies working my way up from real estate, interior designers to an amazing opportunity to work with Grindr.    
</p>

	I've always been interested in art, geek and pop culture.  I love going to Comic Con and other annual conventions.
